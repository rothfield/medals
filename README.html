<p>This Module shows up to 10 countries that have won the most  medals of a given kind in the Olympics games.  It has the  following requirements:
-It can accept up to two parameters: </p>
<ul>
<li>element_id - an id of the element that the module will use  as its  container. </li>
<li>sort -­‐ determines the type of medals to sort by. It can have 
one of the  following values: 'total', 'gold', 'silver' and 
'bronze'. </li>
</ul>
<p>-If no sort parameter is passed the sort should be by gold 
medals.</p>
<p>-When ranking by total medals, ties are broken by most 
gold.</p>
<p>-When ranking by gold, ties are broken by most silver. 
-When ranking by silver, ties are broken by most gold. 
-When ranking by bronze, ties are broken by most gold. </p>
<p>-Users can click the column headers to re-­‐sort the 
countries by gold, silver,  bronze, or total medals won. 
With each sort the possibility exists that new  countries 
will enter and depart the top 10. </p>
<p>-Please follow the design shown in the screenshots on the 
following pages. </p>
<p>-A sprite with the 13 countries flags (in alphabetical order 
according to their country code) can be found here:

<p>-To get the list of countries and their medals use the 
following URL: https://s3-­‐us-­‐west-­‐
2.amazonaws.com/reuters.medals-­‐widget/medals.json </p>
<p>Note that this should be loaded dynamically using an Ajax 
call (simulate a call to a live API endpoint). Give an 
appropriate error message if there was an error 
retrieving the JSON data (if in real production scenario 
the API is down, you can simulate that by running the 
widget but turning off your wifi/internet connection). 
Also note that although this is hosted on S3, a CORS file 
was set on this folder and thus this data can be retrieved 
with a regular Ajax request (no need for JSONP). 
You can use whatever frameworks, templates or other libraries  you want. Please explain briefly why you chose them.  Your  code can live on a server or emailed back as a zip file 
containing all the assets needed (html, css, js). If you use a zip 
zip file please email it to: talgiat@gmail.com.</p>
